## Subject: Understanding and Application of Antibody Therapies in Cancer Treatment

## Summary of the Key Scientific Question (KSQ):

The KSQ seeks to investigate how existing FDA-approved antibody therapies, specifically Trastuzumab (targeting HER2) and Bevacizumab (targeting VEGF), can be applied to treat a broader range of cancers beyond their currently approved indications. This exploration aims to leverage single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from cancer cell lines to uncover potential therapeutic opportunities.
### What are Cancer Cell Lines?
Cancer cell lines are cultured cells that originate from a cancerous tissue (Mirabelli & Salvatore,2019). They are used extensively in research as in vitro models to study cancer biology and test drug efficacy.
### What is scRNA-seq?
