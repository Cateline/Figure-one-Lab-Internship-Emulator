## Memo: Breaking Down the KSQ for Cancer Drug Development Using scRNA-seq Data
The KSQ seeks to investigate how existing FDA-approved antibody therapies, specifically Trastuzumab (targeting HER2) and Bevacizumab (targeting VEGF), can be applied to treat a broader range of cancers beyond their currently approved indications. This exploration aims to leverage single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from cancer cell lines to uncover potential therapeutic opportunities.
### What are Cancer Cell Lines?
Cancer cell lines are cultured cells that originate from a cancerous tissue (Mirabelli & Salvatore,2019). They are used extensively in research as in vitro models to study cancer biology and test drug efficacy.
### What is scRNA-seq?
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a genomic technique used to analyze the gene expression of individual cells.  It allows researchers to study cellular responses and understand the molecular characteristics of individual cells, revealing cellular heterogeneity and identifying rare cell populations (Haque et al., 2017).
#### Why Use scRNA-seq Data in Cancer Research
scRNA-seq data helps to understand the heterogeneity of cancer cells, revealing how different cells within a tumor respond to therapies. It enables researchers to identify which cells express specific targets like HER2 or VEGF, crucial for therapies like Trastuzumab or Bevacizumab(Jovic, et al.,2022).
### What are Antibody Therapies?
Antibody therapies are treatments that use antibodies to target specific diseases. Antibodies are designed to bind to specific antigens, such as proteins on the surface of cancer cells or viruses, to neutralize them or mark them for destruction by the immune system*(Sharma et al., 2023). They work by blocking receptors, activating immune responses, or delivering cytotoxic agents directly to diseased cells.
#### Connecting scRNA-seq Data to Antibody Therapies
By analyzing scRNA-seq data, researchers can identify the expression levels of HER2 and VEGF in various cancer cell lines. If a cancer cell line shows high expression of HER2 or VEGF, it could be a candidate for treatment with Trastuzumab or Bevacizumab.
### How does Trastuzumab target HER2 (mechanism of action)?
Trastuzumab targets HER2(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) through several collective mechanisms of action(Maadi et al., 2021):
1. It binds to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor, inhibiting the formation of HER2 homodimers and HER2-HER3 heterodimers, which disrupts crucial downstream signaling pathways like the PI3K/AKT pathway that promote cell survival and proliferation. 
2. Additionally, trastuzumab induces the internalization of the HER2 receptor, leading to its degradation or recycling, thereby affecting its availability for signaling. 
3. The drug also facilitates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by allowing the Fc region of trastuzumab to be recognized by FcÎ³ receptors on immune effector cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, which then release cytotoxic molecules that induce apoptosis in HER2-positive tumor cells.
4. Trastuzumab increases the expression of ADAM17, which inhibits the production of HER-specific ligands, further reducing HER2 activation. 
### How does Bevacizumab target VEGF (mechanism of action)?
Bevacizumab  is a humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to and neutralizes circulating VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor A). VEGF, a potent proangiogenic growth factor  that stimulates the proliferation, migration, and survival of endothelial cells plays a critical role in the development of tumor angiogenesis(Kazazi et al,2010).
By binding to VEGF, bevacizumab inhibits the binding of VEGF to its cell surface receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 on endothelial cells. This inhibition of VEGF signaling leads to a reduction in the microvascular growth of tumor blood vessels, thereby limiting the blood supply to the tumor tissues. The reduced blood supply also lowers the tissue interstitial pressure, increases vascular permeability, may improve delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, and favors apoptosis of tumor endothelial cells.
