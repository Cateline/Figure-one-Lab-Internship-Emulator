Subject: Understanding and Application of Antibody Therapies in Cancer Treatment

Summary of the Key Scientific Question (KSQ):

The KSQ seeks to investigate how existing FDA-approved antibody therapies, specifically Trastuzumab (targeting HER2) and Bevacizumab (targeting VEGF), can be applied to treat a broader range of cancers beyond their currently approved indications. This exploration aims to leverage single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from cancer cell lines to uncover potential therapeutic opportunities.
