## Subject: Understanding and Application of Antibody Therapies in Cancer Treatment

## Summary of the Key Scientific Question (KSQ):

The KSQ seeks to investigate how existing FDA-approved antibody therapies, specifically Trastuzumab (targeting HER2) and Bevacizumab (targeting VEGF), can be applied to treat a broader range of cancers beyond their currently approved indications. This exploration aims to leverage single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from cancer cell lines to uncover potential therapeutic opportunities.
### What are Cancer Cell Lines?
Cancer cell lines are cultured cells that originate from a cancerous tissue (Mirabelli & Salvatore,2019). They are used extensively in research as in vitro models to study cancer biology and test drug efficacy.
### What is scRNA-seq?
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a genomic technique used to analyze the gene expression of individual cells.  It allows researchers to study cellular responses and understand the molecular characteristics of individual cells, revealing cellular heterogeneity and identifying rare cell populations (Haque et al., 2017).
#### Why Use scRNA-seq Data in Cancer Research
scRNA-seq data helps to understand the heterogeneity of cancer cells, revealing how different cells within a tumor respond to therapies. It enables researchers to identify which cells express specific targets like HER2 or VEGF, crucial for therapies like Trastuzumab or Bevacizumab(Jovic, et al.,2022).
